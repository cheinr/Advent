      This is a simple example based on the helloworld.html example at:
      facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html

      However it uses the react build from the cloudflare cdn instead of the one
      included in the Starter Kit.

      I think using cdn's would definitely be the easiest way to get started
      using react. We could look at using tools like webpack to build libraries
      (react, react-dom, babel etc.) but that takes a lot of work to get setup.
